- **Wireless Networks**: Non-wired networks detected by containers.
  - **Identified**: Networks with broadcasted SSIDs.
  - **Unidentified**: Networks without visible SSIDs.

## Steps

Follow these steps to launch attacks and detect them with a DCX Edge Sensor:

1. Obtain a license to deploy a DCX Edge Sensor container.
2. Register for an account at [https://dcx.guarddog.ai](https://dcx.guarddog.ai).
3. Login with your credentials.
4. Ensure the host where you deploy the containers has access to the local network and the internet.
5. Deploy the container and allow time for updates to complete.
6. Rregistration of the deployed container occurs automatically.
7. Once operational, the container will display three green status icons.
8. Ensure the container is functional by viewing network data.
9. If available, protect your wireless network by going to **Networks > Wireless Networks**.
10. We recommend filling out all the information in your profile to complete the task.
