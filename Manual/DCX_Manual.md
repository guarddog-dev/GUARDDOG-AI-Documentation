## Analytics

This page shows a more advanced view of what you saw in Summary. It hows the overall information for the entire system including data from all containers registered in the system. Depending on the size and resolution of the screen it may fully show the menu on the left hand side of the screen or show a reduced menu, known as the “hamburger menu icon”. You can display the menu by clicking on it.

### The Containers card 

The first card we show in the Analytics page is the Containers card. 
1.	This shows the total number of containers registered in the system
2.	The number of containers that are offline and online. This refers to the containers that are communicating or not with the main system in the Cloud. Once we do not see the container connected then we will show that container as offline.
3.	We also show our proprietary simple security score. The Security Score is a graphical representation of the risk and vulnerability of your network and the assets in it. Today the simple score is based on the containers you have, the vulnerabilities found and then severity level of those vulnerabilities.
4.	There is also the notion of Local and Remote network/containers. Please refer to the Terminology section for more information on this categorization. 
5.	The tip of the arrow takes you to the Units page when clicked on. See the Units section for more information.


### The attacks card

This shows if there have been any attacks so far on your network within the time interval chosen for the module, please refer to the Settings section for more information on this.
1.	Total number of attacks
2.	The amount of time it took to detect all the attacks
3.	The amount of time that it took to contain the attacks
4.	Click on the arrow to open the attacks page




## The attacks page

This page shows all the attacks detected by al units in the system. Here is a sample of it.



### The attack card

Below we show cards for detection and for mitigation both expanded and collapsed, for more information on this please see Terminology. The card has several elements:
1.	Name of the attack detected.
2.	MAC address of the attacker.
3.	Date of the attack.
4.	Time the action started.
5.	Percentage of attacks based on overall total.
6.	Manufacturer of the attacking device.
7.	Information/description icon.
8.	Arrow to expand/collapse the card.
9.	Unit that performed the action.
10.	Total time that took for the action to be performed.
11.	Time at which the action performed finished.


## The Vulnerabilities card

This shows the overall threats information in the system both in local and remote units. Please refer to the Terminology section for more information.
1.	Arrow to open the threats page.
2.	Local score. The severity level of all local units
3.	Remote score. The severity vulnerability level of all remote units.
4.	Number of local threats. Total number of threats found by local units.
5.	Number of remote threats. Total number of threats found by remote units.




## The Vulnerabilities page

The page shows all the threats found by all units in the system.



### The Vulnerabilities card 

This card shows the information about a specific threat found on a device connected to the network. The following items are part of the card:
1.	CVE of the vulnerability.
2.	Device where the vulnerability was found.
3.	Software affected.
4.	Brief description of the vulnerability.
5.	Open port related to it.
6.	Information/description icon.
7.	Arrow to go to NIST article about the vulnerability.
8.	Score of vulnerability.
9.	Version impacted.
10.	Date discovered.



### The networks card. 

This shows information from the different networks detected by all units, local and remote, registered in the system. Depending on the configuration of the network this will show all devices connected to the network whether they are wired or wireless. Wireless in this card refers to wireless networks found by all the units. For a definition on how local and remote units are classified please refer to the Terminology section.
1.	Arrow to open the networks page. The networks page. This takes to same page the Network menu item does. You can get more details by going to the Networks menu option.
2.	Local. These shown here are all network devices found by local units.
3.	Remote. These represent the total number of connected devices found by remote units.
4.	Local wireless. These are the wireless networks, and surrounding wireless devices transmitting, found by local units.
5.	Remote wireless. These are the wireless networks, and surrounding wireless devices transmitting, found by remote units.




### The scans card

The system is constantly scanning multiple times an hour in both the wire and wireless connections. This is represented by the average number of scans performed in 1 hour based on the last 24 hours. The way to ready this in our example would be that the local units scanned the wired network an average of 87 times per hour, and for the wireless would be that the units scanned the wireless area around them an average of 63 times per hour.
1.	Local wired scans.
2.	Remote wired scans.
3.	Local wireless scans.
4.	Remote wireless scans. 



### The global map

The system is designed with growth and being capable of managing multiple devices throughout the world. In the map we show a shield icon on those locations where a fido unit has been deployed. By clicking on the shield we will show the device GDS id and its location.
