## Terminology

- **Security Score**: The Security Score is a graphical representation of the risk and vulnerability of your network and the assets in it. Today the simple score is based on the containers you have, the vulnerabilities found and then severity level of those vulnerabilities.
- **MAC Address**: Media access control address uniquely identifies network devices.
- **IP Address**: A unique string identifying devices using Internet Protocol.
- **Notifications**: System alerts for attacks, vulnerabilities, or events.
- **Containers**: Devices (physical or virtual) connected to the network.
- **Attacks**: Incidents that compromise the network.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities on network devices posing risks.
- **Card**: UI representation of information.
- **CVE**: Common Vulnerability and Exposure.
- **NIST**: Authority in vulnerability classification.
- **Networks**: Local and remote network assets.
  - **Local Networks**: Network where the container is deployed and full visibility wanted (e.g., corporate, campus networks).
  - **Remote Networks**: External or private network where the container is deployed by confidentiality and privacy are required (e.g., home office).
- **Shared Mode**: Mode determining data visibility to the customer.
- **Wireless Networks**: Non-wired networks detected by containers.
  - **Identified**: Networks with broadcasted SSIDs.
  - **Unidentified**: Networks without visible SSIDs.
- **Refresh rate**: Non-wired networks detected by containers.
- **GDS ID**: Identification name for all containers deployed.
- **Serial Number**: Number automatically generated by the system when the container is registered.
- **License Key**: Key generated in the system and provided to the customer to deploy the containers.

### The Containers card 

The first card we show is the Containers card. An arrow shows when there are containers to let you go to the Containers page.
1.	This shows the total number of containers registered in the system
2.	The number of containers that are offline and online. This refers to the containers that are communicating or not with the main system in the Cloud. Once we do not see the container connected then we will show that container as offline.
3.	We also show our proprietary simple security score. The Security Score is a graphical representation of the risk and vulnerability of your network and the assets in it. Today the simple score is based on the containers you have, the vulnerabilities found and then severity level of those vulnerabilities.
4.	There is also the notion of Local and Remote network/containers. Please refer to the Terminology section for more information on this categorization.
